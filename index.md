### CPSC 120

* Lab 8

  Lab 8, part 1 was one of my favorites since I liked the idea that
  we could be making sandwiches through code. Through simple for loops
  I was able to check whether the input was correct and then successfully
  assembled a sandwich. Also to add creating the code was stressful but
  at the same time fun seeing it work.

* Lab 12

  Lab 12, part 1 was another one of my favorites since it was the first
  time we used visuals and made an animation. When creating this program
  we used .h file and reading a file to create a working moving image.
  The result from this lab was very satisfying and very enjoyable.

* Lab 10

  Lab 10, part 2 was another favorite of mine as this was another time we were
  able to use files to our advantage. Which we used many checkers to see if
  the input was correct and then traversed a matrix to give the correct result. I
  liked this one since I could see real-world applications in the real world.
